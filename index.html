        <div class="about-me">
            <p>I am a fun-loving innovative local photographer located in Howard County, Maryland. 
            I provide great quality photos while being a friendly and personable photographer for your event.
            My passion for photography exploded when I graduated from film school and received my Panasonic Lumix GH3.
            My knowledge of composition and equipment lead me to discover the similarities between photography and film and has led me to shoot a wide variety of events.
            I have taken photos for <a href="https://www.orioleshangout.com/">The Orioles Hangout</a>, numerous families, and my amazing husband's sporting events!
            I consider myself a people person who enjoys working with all sorts of subjects such as couples, childrens, babies, dogs, cats, and even farm animals.
            <br>
